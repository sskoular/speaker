1	ABIGAIL	 Uncle? Susanna Wallcott’s here from Dr. Griggs.
1	PARRIS	 Oh? The Doctor.  Let her come, let her come.
1	ABIGAIL	 Come in Susanna.
1	PARRIS	 What does the doctor say, child?
1	SUSANNA	 Dr. Griggs he bid me come and tell you, Reverend sir, that he cannot 
1	PARRIS	 Then he must search on.
1	SUSANNA	 Aye, sir, he have been searchin’ his books since he left you, 
1	PARRIS	 No-no. There be no unnatural causes here. Tell him I have sent for Reverend 
1	SUSANNA	 Aye, sir. He bid me tell you.
1	PARRIS	 Go directly home and speak nothin’ of unnatural causes.
1	SUSANNA	 Aye, sir, I pray for her. 
1	ABIGAIL	 Uncle, the rumor of witchcraft is all about; I think you’d best 
1	PARRIS	 And what shall I say to them? That my daughter and my niece I discovered 
1	ABIGAIL	 Uncle, we did dance; let you tell them I confessed it. But they’re 
1	PARRIS	 Abigail, I cannot go before the congregation when I know you have not 
1	ABIGAIL	 We did dance, Uncle, and when you leaped out of the bush so suddenly, 
1	PARRIS	 Child. Sit you down. Now look you, child-if you trafficked with spirits 
1	ABIGAIL	 I know it, Uncle.
1	PARRIS	 There is a faction that is sworn to drive me from my pulpit. Do you 
1	ABIGAIL	 I think so, sir.
1	PARRIS	 Now then-in the midst of such disruption, my own household is discovered 
1	ABIGAIL	 It were only sport, Uncle!
1	PARRIS	 I saw Tituba waving her arms over the fire when I came on you; why were 
1	ABIGAIL	 She always sings her Barbados songs and we dance. 
1	PARRIS	 I cannot blink what I saw, Abigail-for my enemies will not blink it. 
1	ABIGAIL	 No one was naked! You mistake yourself, Uncle!
1	PARRIS	 I saw it! Now tell me true, Abigail. Now my ministry’s at stake; 
1	ABIGAIL	 There is nothin’ more. I swear it, Uncle.
1	PARRIS	 Abigail, is there any other cause than you have told me, for Goody Proctor 
1	ABIGAIL	 They want slaves, not such as I. Let them send to Barbados for that, 
1	PARRIS	 Why, Goody Putnam, come in.
1	ANN	 It is a marvel. It is surely a stroke of hell upon you…
1	PARRIS	 No, Goody Putnam, it is…
1	ANN	 How high did she fly, how high?
1	PARRIS	 No—no, she never flew…
1	ANN	 Why, it’s sure she did; Mister Collins saw her goin’ over Ingersoll’s 
1	PARRIS	 Now, look you, Goody Putnam; she never… Oh, good morning, Mister Putnam…
1	PUTNAM	 It is a providence the thing is out now! It is a providence.
1	PARRIS	 What’s out, sir, what’s…?
1	PUTNAM	  Why, her eyes is closed! Look you, Ann.
1	ANN	 Why, that’s strange. Ours is open.
1	PARRIS	 Your little Ruth is sick?
1	ANN	 I’d not call it sick, the Devil’s touch is heavier than sick, 
1	PARRIS	 Oh, pray not! Why, how does your child ail?
1	ANN	 She ails as she must—she never waked this morning but her eyes open 
1	PUTNAM	 They say you’ve sent for Reverend Hale of Beverly? 
1	PARRIS	 A precaution only. He has much experience in all demonic arts, and I 
1	ANN	 He has indeed, and found by a witch in Beverly last year, and let you remember 
1	PARRIS	 I pray you, leap not to witchcraft. I know that you, you least of all, 
1	PUTNAM	 Now, look you, Mr. Parris; I have taken your part in all contention 
1	PARRIS	 But, Thomas, you cannot…
1	PUTNAM	 Ann! Tell Mister Parris what you have done.
1	ANN	 Reverend Parris, I have laid seven babies unbaptized in the earth. Believe 
1	PARRIS	 To Tituba! What may Tituba….?
1	ANN	 Tituba knows how to speak to the dead, Mister Parris.
1	PARRIS	 Goody Ann, it is a formidable sin to conjure up the dead!
1	ANN	 I take it on my soul, but who else may surely tell us who murdered my babies.
1	PARRIS	 Woman!
1	ANN	 They were murdered, Mister Parris! And mark this proof! –mark it! 
1	PUTNAM	 Don’t you understand it, sir? There is a murdering witch among 
1	PARRIS	 Then you were conjuring spirits last night.
1	ABIGAIL	 Not I, sir, not I.-Tituba and Ruth.
1	PARRIS	 Now I am undone.
1	PUTNAM	 You are not undone. Let you take hold here. Wait for no one to charge 
1	PARRIS	 In my house!? In my house, Thomas?-they will topple me with this! They 
1	MERCY	 Your pardons…I only thought to see how Betty is.
1	PUTNAM	 Why aren’t you home? Who’s with Ruth?
1	MERCY	 Her grandma come. She’s improved a little, I think-she give a powerful 
1	ANN	 Ah, there’s a sign of life!
1	PARRIS	 Will you leave me now Thomas, I would pray a while alone…
1	ABIGAIL	 Uncle, you’ve prayed since midnight. Why do you not go down and….?
1	PARRIS	 No-no. I’ll wait till Mister Hale arrives. 
1	PUTNAM	 Now look you, sir-let you strike out against the Devil and the village 
1	PARRIS	 I have no stomach for disputation this morning. I will lead them in 
1	ANN	 Mercy, you go home to Ruth, d’ye hear?
1	MERCY	 Aye, Mum. 
1	PARRIS	 If she starts for the window, cry for me at once. 
1	ABIGAIL	 Yes, Uncle.  How is Ruth sick?
1	MERCY	 It’s weirdish, I know not—she seems to walk like a dead one 
1	ABIGAIL	 Now look you, if they be questioning us tell them we danced—I 
1	MERCY	 And what more?
1	ABIGAIL	 He saw you naked.
1	MERCY	 Oh, Jesus! 
1	MARY	 I just come from the farm, the whole country’s talking witchcraft! 
1	ABIGAIL	  Betty? Now, Betty, dear, wake up now. It’s 
1	BETTY	  You drank blood, Abby, you drank blood!
1	ABIGAIL	  Betty, you never 
1	BETTY	 You did, you did! You drank a charm to kill John Proctor’s wife! 
1	ABIGAIL	  Shut it! Now shut it!  
1	PROCTOR	 Be you foolish, Mary Warren? Be you deaf? I forbid you leave the house, 
1	MERCY	  
1	ABIGAIL	 She’s only gone silly, somehow. She’ll come out of it.
1	PROCTOR	 So she flies, eh? Where are her wings?
1	ABIGIAL	  Oh, John, sure you’re not believin’ 
1	PROCTOR	 The road past my house is a pilgrimage to Salem all morning. The town’s 
1	ABIGAIL	 Oh, posh!—We were dancin’ in the woods last night, and 
1	PROCTOR	  Dancin’ by moonlight!  You’ll be clapped in the stocks before you’re 
1	ABIGAIL	  Give me a word, John. A soft word.
1	PROCTOR	 I come to see what mischief your uncle’s brewin’ now. Put 
1	ABIGAIL	 John—I am waitin’ for you every night.
1	PROCTOR	 Abby, you’ll put it out of mind. I’ll not be comin’ 
1	ABIGAIL	 I know how you clutched my back behind your house and sweated like 
1	PROCTOR	  Child…
1	ABIGAIL	  How do you call me 
1	PROCTOR	  
1	ABIGAIL	  Oh, I marvel how such a  strong man may let such a sickly wife be…
1	PROCTOR	  You’ll speak nothin’ of 
1	ABIGAIL	 She is blackening my name in the village! She is telling lies about 
1	PROCTOR	  Do you look for whippin’!
1	ABIGAIL	  You loved me, John Proctor, and whatever sin it is you 
1	PARRIS	 What Happened? What are you doing to her! Betty! 
1	ABIGAIL	 She heard you singin’ and suddenly she’s up to screamin’…
1	ANN	  The psalm! The psalm! – she cannot hear the Lord’s 
1	PARRIS	 No, God forbid…
1	ANN	 Mark it for a sign, mark it…! 
1	PUTNAM	 That is a notorious sign of witchcraft afoot, a prodigious sign.
1	ANN	 My mother told me that! That they cannot bear to hear the name of…
1	PARRIS	 Rebecca, Rebecca, come to her..we’re lost, she suddenly cannot 
1	ANN	 What have you done?
1	REBECCA	 Pray, calm yourselves. I have eleven children and I am twenty-six times 
1	ANN	 This is no silly season, Rebecca. My Ruth is bewildered, Rebecca, she cannot 
1	REBECCA	 Perhaps she is not hungered yet. Mr. Paris, I hope you are not decided 
1	PARRIS	 A wide opinion’s running in the parish that the Devil may be among 
1	PROCTOR	 Then let you come out and call them wrong. Are you our minister or 
1	PARRIS	 He is not coming to look for devils!
1	PROCTER	 Then what is he coming to look for?
1	PUTNAM	 There will be children dyin’ in the village, Mister…!
1	PROCTER	 I see nothing dyin’
1	REBECCA	 Pray, John…be calm. Mister Parris, I think you’d best be 
1	ANN	 Rebecca, the docter’s baffled.
1	REBECCA	 If so he is, then let us go to God for the cause of it. There is prodigious 
1	PUTNAM	 How may we blame ourselves? I am one of nine sons; the Putnam seed have 
1	REBECCA	 I cannot fathom that!
1	PUTNAM	 When Reverend Hale comes you will proceed to look for signs of witchcraft 
1	PROCTOR	 You cannot command Mister Parris. We vote by name in this society, 
1	PUTNAM	 I never heard you worried so on this society, Mister Proctor. I do not 
1	PROCTOR	 I have trouble enough without I come five mile to hear him preach only 
1	PARRIS	 I am your third preacher in seven years. I do not wish to be put out 
1	PUTNAM	 Aye!
1	PARRIS	 There is either obedience or the church will burn like hell is burning!
1	PROCTOR	 Can you speak one minute without we land in hell again? I am sick of 
1	PARRIS	 It is not for you to say what is good for you to hear!
1	PROTCTOR	 I may speak my heart, I think!
1	PARRIS	 What, are we Quakers? We are not Quakers here yet, Mister Proctor. And 
1	PROCTOR	 My followers!
1	PARRIS	 There is a party in this church; I am not blind; there is a faction 
1	PROCTOR	 Against you?
1	PUTNAM	 Against him and all authority.
1	PROCTOR	 Why, then I must find it and join it.
1	REBECCA	 He does not mean that….
1	PROCTOR	 I mean it solemnly, Rebecca; I like not the smell of this “authority,” 
1	COREY	 I’ve changed my opinion of this man. Mister Parris, I beg your 
1	PARRIS	 Why thank you, Guiles.
1	COREY	 It suggests to the mind what the trouble be among us all, these years. 
1	PROCTOR	 Is it the devil’s fault that a man cannot say you “Good 
1	COREY	 John Proctor, I have only last month collected four pound damages for 
1	PROCTOR	 I never said no such thing, but I paid you for it, so I hope I can 
1	COREY	 I’ll be damned first! 
1	HALE	 Pray you, someone take these!
1	PARRIS	 Mister Hale! Oh, it’s good to see you again! My, they’re 
1	HALE	 They must be, they are weighted with authority.
1	PARRIS	 Well, you do come prepared!
1	HALE	 We shall need hard study, if it comes to tracking down the Old Boy. You 
1	REBECCA	 I am, sir. Do you know me?
1	HALE	 It’s strange how I knew you, but I suppose you look as such a good 
1	PARRIS	 Do you know this gentleman?—Mister Thomas Putnam. And his good 
1	HALE	 Putnam! I had not expected such distinguished company, sir.
1	PUTNAM	 It does not seem to help us today, Mister Hale. We look to you to come 
1	HALE	 Your child ails, too?!
1	ANN	 Her soul, her soul seems flown away. She sleeps and yet she walks….
1	PUTNAM	 She cannot eat.
1	HALE	 Cannot eat! Do you men also have afflicted children?
1	PARRIS	 No, no, these are farmers. John Proctor…
1	COREY	 He don’t believe in witches. 
1	PROCTOR	 I never spoke on witches one way or the other. Will you come, Giles?
1	COREY	 No-no, John, I think not. I have some few queer questions of my own to 
1	PROCTOR	 I’ve heard you be a sensible man, Mister Hale-I hope you’ll 
1	PARRIS	 Will you look at my daughter, sir? She has tried to leap out the window; 
1	HALE	 Tries to fly?
1	PUTNAM	 She cannot bear to hear the lord’s name, mister Hale; that’s 
1	HALE	 No-no…Now let me instruct you. We cannot look to superstition in 
1	PARRIS	 It is agreed, sir—it is agreed—we will abide by your judgment.
1	HALE	 Good then. Now, sir, what were your first warnings of this strangeness?
1	PARRIS	 Why, sir… I discovered her… and my niece Abigail and ten 
1	HALE	 You permit dancing?!
1	PARRIS	 No—no, it were secret…
1	ANN	 Mr. Parris’ slave has knowledge of conjurin’, sir.
1	PARRIS	 We cannot be sure of that, Goody Ann…
1	ANN	 I know it, sir. I sent my child… she should learn from Tituba who 
1	REBECCA	 Goody Ann! You sent a child to conjure up the dead…?
1	ANN	  Let God blame me, not you, not you, Rebecca! I’ll 
1	HALE	  Seven dead in childbirth?
1	ANN	 Aye. 
1	HALE	 Have no fear now—we shall find this devil out if he has come among 
1	REBECCA	 Will it hurt the child, sir?
1	HALE	 I cannot tell. If she is truly in the Devil’s grip we may have to 
1	REBECCA	 I think I’ll go then. I am too old for this.
1	PARRIS	 Why, Rebecca, we may open up the boil of all our troubles today!
1	REBECCA	 Let us hope for that.  I go to God for you, sir.
1	PARRIS	 I hope you do not mean we go to Satan here!
1	REBECCA	 I wish I knew. 
1	PUTNAM	 Come, Mister Hale, let’s get on. Sit you here. 
1	COREY	 Mister Hale… I have always wanted to ask a learned man—What 
1	HALE	 What books? 
1	COREY	 I cannot tell; she hides them. Martha, my wife. I have waked at night 
1	HALE	 Why, that’s not necessarily…
1	COREY	 It discomforts me! Last night—mark this—I tried and tried 
1	HALE	 Ah!—the stoppage of prayer—that is strange.  I’d like to speak further on that with you.
1	COREY	 I’m not sayin’ she’s touched the Devil, now, but I’d 
1	HALE	 Aye, we’ll discuss it. Now mark me, if the Devil is in her you will 
1	ABIGAIL	 Why—common dancing is all.
1	PARRIS	 I think I ought to say that I—I saw a kettle in the grass where 
1	ABIGAIL	 That were only soup.
1	HALE	 Soup? What sort of soup were in this kettle, Abigail?
1	ABIGAIL	 Why, it were beans—and lintels, I think, and—
1	HALE	 Mister Parris, you did not notice, did you—any living thing in the 
1	ABIGAIL	  That frog jumped in, we 
1	HALE	 Abigail, it may be your cousin is dying—Did you call the Devil last 
1	ABIGAIL	 I never called him! Tituba called him!
1	PARRIS	 She called the Devil!
1	HALE	 I should like to speak with Tituba.
1	PARRIS	  Goody Ann, will you 
1	HALE	 How did she call him?
1	ABIGAIL	 I know not—she spoke Barbados.
1	HALE	 Did you feel any strangeness when she called him? A sudden cold wind, 
1	ABIGAIL	 I didn’t see no Devil!— Betty, 
1	HALE	 You cannot evade me, Abigail.—Did your cousin drink any of the brew 
1	ABIGAIL	 She never drank it!
1	HALE	 Did you drink it?
1	ABIGAIL	 No, sir!
1	HALE	 Did Tituba ask you to drink it?
1	ABIGAIL	 She tried but I refused.
1	HALE	 Why are you concealing? Have you sold yourself to Lucifer?
1	ABIGAIL	 I never sold myself! I’m a good girl—I— I did drink of the kettle!—She made me do it! She made Betty 
1	TITUBA	 Abby!
1	ABIGAIL	 She makes me drink blood!
1	PARRIS	 Blood!!
1	ANN	 My baby’s blood?
1	TITUBA	 No—no, chicken blood, I give she chicken blood!
1	HALE	 Woman, have you enlisted these children for the devil?
1	TITUBA	 No-no, sir, I don’t truck with the devil.
1	HALE	 Why can she not wake? Are you silencing this child?
1	TITUBA	 I love me Betty!
1	HALE	 You have sent your spirit out upon this child, have you not? Are you gathering 
1	ABIGAIL	 She send her spirit on me in church, she make me laugh at prayer!
1	PARRIS	 She have often laughed at prayer!
1	ABIGAIL	 She comes to me every night to go and drink blood!
1	TITUBA	 You beg me to conjure, Abby! She beg me make charm-
1	ABIGAIL	 I’ll tell you something. She comes to me while I sleep; she’s 
1	TITUBA	 Abby!
1	ABIGAIL	 I always hear her laughing in my sleep. I hear her singing her Barbados 
1	TITUBA	 Mister Reverend, I never-
1	HALE	 When did you compact with the Devil?
1	TITUBA	 I don’t compact with no devil!
1	PARRIS	 You will confess yourself or I will take you out and whip you to your 
1	PUTNAM	 This woman must be hanged! She must be taken and hanged!
2	TITUBA	 No-no, don’t hang Tituba. I tell him I don’t desire to work 
2	HALE	 Who, the Devil? Now, Tituba, I know that when we bind ourselves to Hell 
2	TITUBA	 Ay, sir, a good Christian woman.
2	HALE	 And you love these little children?
2	TITUBA	 Oh, yes, sir, I don’t desire to hurt little children.
2	HALE	 And you love God, Tituba?
2	TITUBA	 I love God with all my bein’.
2	HALE	 Now in God’s holy name…
2	TITUBA	 Bless Him…bless Him…
2	HALE	 And to His Glory…
2	TITUBA	 Eternal Glory…Bless Him….Bless God…
2	HALE	 Open yourself, Tituba-open yourself and let God’s holy light shine 
2	TITUBA	 Oh, bless the Lord.
2	HALE	 When the devil comes to you does he ever come with another person? Perhaps 
2	TITUBA	 There was four. There was four. 
1	PARRIS	 Who? Who? Their names, their names!
1	TITUBA	 Oh, how many times he bid me kill you, mister Parris!
1	PARRIS	 Kill me!
1	TITUBA	 He say Mister Parris must be kill! Mister Parris no goodly man, Mister 
1	PARRIS	 Sarah Good! 
1	TITUBA	 Aye, sir, and Goody Osburn…
1	ANN	 I knew it! Goody Osburn were midwife to me three times. I begged you, Thomas, 
1	HALE	 Take courage, you must give us all their names. How can you bear to see 
1	ABIGAIL	  I want to open myself! I want the light 
1	BETTY	  I saw George Jacobs with the Devil! I saw Goody 
1	PARRIS	 She speaks. She speaks!
1	HALE	 Glory to God!—it is broken, they are free!
1	BETTY	  I saw Martha Bellows 
1	ABIGAIL	  I saw Goody Sibber with the Devil!
1	PUTNAM	 The marshal, I’ll call the marshal!
2	HALE	 Let the marshal bring irons. ELIZABETH: What keeps you so late? It’s almost dark.
2	PROCTOR	 I were planting far out to the forest edge.
2	ELIZABETH	 Oh, you’re done then.
2	PROCTOR	 Aye, the farm is seeded. The boys asleep? 
2	ELIZABETH	  
2	PROCTOR	 Pray now for a fair summer.
2	ELIZABETH	  Aye.
2	PROCTOR	 Are you well today?
2	ELIZABETH	 I am. It is a rabbit.
2	PROCTOR	 Oh, is it! Cider?
2	ELIZABETH	 Aye!  You come so late I thought you’d gone to Salem this afternoon.
2	PROCTOR	 Why? I have no business in Salem.
2	ELIZABETH	 You did speak of goin’, earlier this week.
2	PROCTOR	 I thought better of it, since.
2	ELIZABETH	 Mary Warren’s there today.
2	PROCTOR	 Why’d you let her? You heard me forbid her go to Salem any more!
2	ELIZABETH	 I forbid her go, and she raises up her chin like the daughter of 
2	PROCTOR	 Court! What court?
2	ELIZABETH	 Ay, it is a proper court they have now. They’ve sent four judges 
2	PROCTOR	  Why, she’s mad.
2	ELIZABETH	 I would to God she were. There be fourteen people in the jail now, 
2	PROCTOR	 Ah, they’d never hang….
2	ELIZABETH	 The Deputy Governor promise hangin’ if they’ll not confess, 
2	PROCTOR	 Oh, it is a black mischief.
2	ELIZABETH	 I think you must go to Salem, John. I think so. You must tell them 
2	PROCTOR	 Aye, it is, it is surely.
2	ELIZABETH	 Let you go to Ezekiel Cheever—he knows you well. And tell him 
2	PROCTOR	  Aye, she did, she did.
2	ELIZABETH	  God forbid 
2	PROCTOR	 Ay, they must, they must….It is a wonder that they do believe 
2	ELIZABETH	 I would go to Salem now, John… let you go tonight.
2	PROCTOR	 I’ll think on it.
2	ELIZABETH	  You cannot keep it, John.
2	PROCTOR	  I know I cannot keep it. I say I will think on it!
2	ELIZABETH	  Good then, let you think on it.
2	PROCTOR	  I am only wondering how I may prove what she told me, 
2	ELIZABETH	 You were alone with her?
2	PROCTOR	 For a moment alone, aye.
2	ELIZABETH	 Why, then, it is not as you told me.
2	PROCTOR	 For a moment, I say. The others come in soon after.
2	ELIZABETH	 Do as you wish, then.
2	PROCTOR	 Woman. I’ll not have your suspicion any more.
2	ELIZABETH	  I have no…
2	PROCTOR	 I’ll not have it!
2	ELIZABETH	 Then let you not earn it.
2	PROCTOR	  You doubt me yet?!
2	ELIZABETH	 John, if it were not Abigail that you must go to hurt, would you 
2	PROCTOR	 Now look you…
2	ELIZABETH	 I see what I see, John.
2	PROCTOR	 You will not judge me more, Elizabeth. I have good reason to think 
2	ELIZABETH	 I do not judge you. The magistrate sits in your heart that judges 
2	PROCTOR	 Oh, Elizabeth, your justice would freeze beer.  How dare 
2	MARY	  I am sick, I am sick, Mister Proctor. Pray, pray hurt 
2	PROCTOR	  And what of these proceedings 
2	MARY	  
2	ELIZABETH	  Why, thank you. It’s a 
2	MARY	  We must all love each other 
2	ELIZABETH	  --Aye, indeed we must.
2	MARY	 I’ll get up early in the morning and clean the house. I must sleep 
2	PROCTOR	 Mary. Is it true there be fourteen women arrested? 
2	MARY	 No, sir. There be thirty-nine now…. 
2	ELIZABETH	 Why, she’s weepin’! What ails you, child? 
2	MARY	 Goody Osburn…will hang!
2	PROCTOR	 Hang! Hang, y’say?
2	MARY	 Aye….
2	PROCTOR	 The deputy Governor will permit it?
2	MARY	 He sentenced her. He must-But not Sarah Good. For Sarah Good confessed, 
2	PROCTOR	 Confessed! To what?
2	MARY	 That she sometimes made a compact with Lucifer, and wrote her name in 
2	PROCTOR	 But…surely you know what a jabberer she is. Did you tell them 
2	MARY	 Mister Proctor, in open court she near choked us all to death.
2	PROCTOR	 How choked you?
2	MARY	 She sent her spirit out.
2	ELIZABETH	 Oh, Mary, Mary, surely you…
2	MARY	 She tried to kill me many times, Goody Proctor!
2	ELIZABETH	 Why, I never heard you mention that before.
2	MARY	  I never knew it before. I never knew anything before. When 
2	PROCTOR	  Why?—What did she do to you?
2	MARY	  So many time, Mister 
2	ELIZABETH	 Mumbled! She may mumble, hungry.
2	MARY	 But what does she mumble? You must remember, Goody Proctor—last 
2	ELIZABETH	 Why… I do, think, but…
2	MARY	 And so I told that to Judge Hathorne, and he asks her so—“Goody 
2	ELIZABETH	 And that’s an upright answer.
2	MARY	 Aye, but then Judge Hathorne say, “Recite for us your commandments!”—and 
2	PROCTOR	 And so condemned her?
2	MARY	  Why, they must when she condemned herself.
2	PROCTOR	 But the proof, the proof?
2	MARY	  I told you the proof—it’s 
2	PROCTOR	 You will not go to that court again, Mary Warren.
2	MARY	  I must tell you, sir, I will be gone every day now. I am 
2	PROCTOR	 What work you do! It’s strange work for a Christian girl to hang 
2	MARY	 But, Mister Proctor, they will not hang them if they confess. Sarah Good 
2	ELIZABETH	 Pregnant! Are they mad?—the woman’s near to sixty!
2	MARY	  They had Doctor Griggs examine her 
2	PROCTOR	 I’ll official you! 
2	MARY	  I’ll not stand whipping any more! 
2	PROCTOR	 I’ll whip the Devil out of you…! 
2	MARY	  I saved her life today! 
2	ELIZABETH	  I am accused?
2	MARY	 You were somewhat mentioned. But I said I never see no sign you ever sent 
2	ELIZABETH	 Who accused me?
2	MARY	 I am bound by law; I cannot tell it.
2	PROCTOR	  Go to bed.
2	MARY	 I’ll not be ordered to bed no more, Mister Proctor! I am eighteen 
2	PROCTOR	 Do you wish to sit up?—then sit up.
2	MARY	  I wish to go to bed!
2	PROCTOR	  Good night, then! 
2	MARY	 Good night. 
2	ELIZABETH	 Oh, the noose, the noose is up!
2	PROCTOR	 There’ll be no noose…
2	ELIZABETH	 She wants me dead; I knew all week it would come to this!
2	PROCTOR	 They dismissed it. You heard her say…
2	ELIZABETH	 And what of tomorrow?-she will cry me out until they take me!
2	PROCTOR	 Sit you down…
2	ELIZABETH	 She wants me dead, John, you know it!
2	PROCTOR	 I say sit down! Now, we must be wise, Elizabeth.
2	ELIZABETH	 Oh, indeed, indeed!
2	PROCTOR	 Fear nothing. I’ll find Ezekiel Cheever. I’ll tell him 
2	ELIZABETH	 John, with so many in the jail, more than that is needed now, I think. 
2	PROCTOR	 What have I to say to Abigail?
2	ELIZABETH	 John…grant me this. You have a faulty understanding of young 
2	PROCTOR	 What promise?
2	ELIZABETH	 Spoke or silent, a promise is surely made. And she may dote on it 
2	PROCTOR	 She cannot think it.
2	ELIZABETH	 John, have you ever shown her somewhat of contempt? She cannot pass 
2	PROCTOR	 I may blush for my sin.
2	ELIZABETH	 I think she sees another meaning in that blush.
2	PROCTOR	 And what see you? What you see, Elizabeth.
2	ELIZABETH	 I think you be somewhat ashamed, for I am there, and she so close.
2	PROCTOR	 When will you know me, woman? Were I stone I would have cracked for 
2	ELIZABETH	 Then go-and tell her she’s a whore. Whatever promise she may 
2	PROCTOR	 Good, then. I’ll go.
2	HALE	 Good evening.
2	PROCTOR	 Why, Mister Hale! Good evening to you, sir. Come in, come in.
2	HALE	 I hope I do not startle you.
2	ELIZABETH	 No-no, it’s only that I heard no horse…
2	HALE	 You are Goodwife Proctor.
2	PROCTOR	 Aye: Elizabeth.
2	HALE	 I hope you’re not off to bed yet.
2	PROCTOR	 No-no…let you come in, Mister Hale. We are not used to visitors 
2	HALE	 I will. Let you sit, Goodwife Proctor.
2	PROCTOR	 Will you drink cider, Mister Hale?
2	HALE	 No, it rebels my stomach—I have some further traveling yet tonight. 
2	PROCTOR	 Business of the court?
2	HALE	  No… no, I come of my own, without the court’s 
2	PROCTOR	 We know it, sir. Our Mary Warren told us. We are entirely amazed.
2	HALE	 I am a stranger here, as you know. And in my ignorance, I find it hard 
2	ELIZABETH	  Rebecca’s charged!
2	PROCTOR	  Surely you cannot think so.
2	HALE	 This is a strange time, Mister. No man may longer doubt the powers of 
2	PROCTOR	  I… have no knowledge in that line. But it’s 
2	HALE	 Aye. But the Devil is a wily one, you cannot deny it. However, she is 
2	PROCTOR	 Why, we… have no fear of questions, sir.
2	HALE	 Good, then. In the book of record that Mister Parris keeps, I note that 
2	PROCTOR	 No, sir, you are mistaken….
2	HALE	 Only twenty-six time in seventeen month, sir. I must call that rare. Will 
2	PROCTOR	 Mister Hale,  I never knew I 
2	HALE	  So I am told. But you, Mister, why could you not come alone?
2	PROCTOR	 I surely did come when I could, and when I could not I prayed in this 
2	HALE	 Mister Proctor, your house is not a church. A Christian on Sabbath Day 
2	PROCTOR	 Aye. Boys.
2	HALE	 How come it that only two are baptized?
2	PROCTOR	  I like it not that Mister Parris should lay his hand upon my 
2	HALE	 I must say it, Mister Proctor; that is not for you to decide. The man’s 
2	PROCTOR	 It may be I have been too quick to bring the man to book, but you cannot 
2	HALE	 I… have… there is a softness in your record, sir, a softness.
2	ELIZABETH	 I think, maybe, we have been too hard with Mister Parris. I think 
2	HALE	 Do you know your commandments, Elizabeth?
2	ELIZABETH	  I surely do. There be no mark 
2	HALE	 And you, Mister?
2	PROCTOR	 I… am sure I do, sir.
2	HALE	 Let you repeat them, if you will.
2	PROCTOR	 …The Commandments?
2	HALE	 Aye.
2	PROCTOR	 Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s goods, 
2	HALE	 You have said that twice, sir.
2	PROCTOR	 Aye.
2	ELIZABETH	  Adultery, John.
2	PROCTOR	  Aye!  You see, sir, between the two of us we do know them 
2	HALE	  Theology, sir, is a fortress; no crack 
2	PROCTOR	 There be no love for Satan in this house.
2	HALE	 I pray it, I pray it dearly.  Well, then, I’ll bid you 
2	ELIZABETH	  Mister Hale. I do think you are 
2	HALE	 Goody Proctor, I do not judge you. My duty is to add what I may to the 
2	ELIZABETH	  I think you must tell him, John.
2	HALE	 What’s that?
2	ELIZABETH	 Will you tell him?
2	PROCTOR	 I… I have no witness and cannot prove it, except my word be taken. 
2	HALE	  Naught to do…?
2	PROCTOR	 They were discovered by Mr. Parris sporting in the woods. They were 
2	HALE	 Who told you this?
2	PROCTOR	 Abigail Williams.
2	HALE	 Abigail!
2	PROCTOR	 Aye. She told me the day you came, sir?
2	HALE	 Why… why did you keep this?
2	PROCTOR	 I never knew until tonight that the world is gone daft with this nonsense.
2	HALE	 Nonsense! Mister, I have myself examined Tituba, Sarah Good and numerous 
2	PROCTOR	  And why not, if they must hang for denyin’ 
2	HALE	  I have. I… I have 
2	PROCTOR	 I…. had not reckoned with going into court…. But if I must 
2	HALE	 Ah, you falter there? I think you…
2	PROCTOR	  …I falter nothing, but I… I may 
2	HALE	  Proctor, let you open with me now, 
2	PROCTOR	 I have no knowledge of it; the Bible speaks of witches, and I will 
2	HALE	 And you, woman?
2	ELIZABETH	 I… I cannot believe it.
2	HALE	  You cannot!
2	ELIZABETH	 I cannot think the Devil may own a woman’s soul, Mister Hale, 
2	HALE	 You surely do not fly against the Gospel, the Gospel…
2	PROCTOR	 She do not mean to doubt the Gospel, sir, you cannot think it. This 
2	HALE	  God keep you both; let the third child be quickly baptized 
2	COREY	 John!
2	PROCTOR	 Giles! What’s the matter?
2	COREY	 They take my wife. And Rebecca Nurse! 
2	PROCTOR	  Rebecca’s in the jail!
2	NURSE	 John, Cheever come and take her in his wagon. We’ve only now come 
2	ELIZABETH	 They’ve surely gone wild now, Mister Hale!
2	NURSE	 Reverend Hale. Can you not speak to the Deputy Governor?—I’m 
2	HALE	 Pray calm yourself, Mister Nurse….
2	NURSE	 My wife is the very brick and mortar of the church, Mister Hale—and 
2	HALE	  How is Rebecca charged, Mr. Nurse?
2	NURSE	 For murder, she’s charged! “For the marvelous and supernatural 
2	HALE	 Believe me, sir, if Rebecca Nurse be tainted, then nothing’s left 
2	NURSE	 You cannot mean she will be tried in the court!
2	PROCTOR	 How may such a woman murder children?
2	HALE	 Man, remember, until an hour before the Devil fell, God thought him beautiful 
2	COREY	 I never said my wife were a witch, Mister Hale, I only said she were 
2	HALE	 Mister Corey, exactly what complaint were made on your wife?
2	COREY	 That bloody mongrel Walcott charge her. Y’see, he buy a pig of 
2	CHEEVER	 Good evening. Good evening to you, John Proctor. 
2	PROCTOR	 Why… Mister Cheever. Good evening. I hope you come not on business 
2	CHEEVER	 I do, Proctor, aye. I am clerk of the court now, y’know.  I have a warrant for your wife.
2	PROCTOR	 What say you? A warrant for my wife? Who charged her?
2	CHEEVER	 Why, Abigail Williams charge her.
2	PROCTOR	 Abigail Williams? On what proof, what proof!
2	CHEEVER	 Mister Proctor, I have little time…. The court bid me search 
2	PROCTOR	 Poppets?
2	ELIZABETH	 I never kept no poppets, not since I were a girl.
2	CHEEVER	 I spy a poppet, Goody Proctor.
2	ELIZABETH	  Oh!—Why, this is Mary’s.
2	CHEEVER	 Would you please to give it to me?
2	ELIZABETH	  Has the court discovered a text in poppets 
2	CHEEVER	  Do you keep any others in this house?
2	PROCTOR	 No, nor this one either till tonight. 
2	CHEEVER	 Now, woman… will you please to come with me.
2	PROCTOR	 She will not.  Fetch Mary here. 
2	HALE	  What signifies a poppet, Mister Cheever?
2	CHEEVER	  Why, they say it may signify that she… 
2	PROCTOR	 What’s there?
2	CHEEVER	 Why…  it is a needle!
2	PROCTOR	 And what signifies a needle?
2	CHEEVER	 The girl, the Williams girl, Abigail Williams, sir. She sat to dinner 
2	PROCTOR	 Why, she done it herself! I hope you’re not takin’ this 
2	CHEEVER	 ‘Tis hard proof.—I find here a poppet Goody Proctor keeps. 
2	PROCTOR	 Here now! Mary, how did this poppet come into my house?
2	MARY	 What poppet’s that, sir?
2	PROCTOR	 This poppet, this poppet.
2	MARY	  Why, I… I think it is mine.
2	PROCTOR	  It is your poppet, is it not?
2	MARY	 It … is, sir.
2	PROCTOR	 And how did it come into this house?
2	MARY	 Why… I made it in the court, sir, and… give it to Goody Proctor 
2	PROCTOR	  Now, sir—do you have it?
2	HALE	 Mary Warren… a needle have been found inside this poppet.
2	MARY	 Why, I meant no harm by it, sir….
2	PROCTOR	 You stuck that needle in yourself?
2	MARY	 I… I believe I did, sir, I…
2	PROCTOR	 What say you now?
2	HALE	  Child… you are certain 
2	MARY	 Conjures me?—Why, no, sir, I am entirely myself, I think. Let you 
2	HALE	 Mary… you charge a cold and cruel murder on Abigail.
2	MARY	 Murder! I charge no…
2	HALE	 Abigail were stabbed tonight; a needle were found stuck into her belly….
2	ELIZABETH	 And she charges me?!
2	HALE	 Aye.
2	ELIZABETH	 Why…!—The girl is murder! She must be ripped out of the 
2	CHEEVER	 You’ve heard that, sir!—Ripped out of the world! You heard 
2	PROCTOR	  
2	CHEEVER	 You’ve ripped the Deputy Governor’s warrant, man!
2	PROCTOR	 Damn the Deputy Governor! Out of my house!
2	HALE	 Now, Proctor, Proctor…
2	PROCTOR	  Get y’ gone with them! You are a broken minister.
2	HALE	 Proctor, if she is innocent the court…
2	PROCTOR	 If she is innocent! Why do you never wonder if Parris be innocent, 
2	ELIZABETH	 I’ll go, John…
2	PROCTOR	 You will not go! 
2	ELIZABETH	 John…  I think I must go with 
2	PROCTOR	  I will bring you home. I will bring you soon.
2	ELIZABETH	 Oh, John, bring me soon!
2	PROCTOR	 I will fall like an ocean on that court! Fear nothing, Elizabeth.
2	ELIZABETH	 I will fear nothing.  Tell the children I have gone to visit someone 
2	HALE	 Mister Proctor…
2	PROCTOR	  Out of my sight!
2	HALE	  Charity, Proctor, Charity—what I have heard in her favor 
2	PROCTOR	 You are a coward! Though you be ordained in God’s own tears, 
2	COREY	 John… tell me, are we lost?
2	PROCTOR	 Go home now, Giles. We’ll speak on it tomorrow.
2	COREY	 Let you think on it; we’ll come early, eh?
2	PROCTOR	 Aye. Go now, Giles.
2	COREY	 Good night, then. 
2	MARY	 Mister Proctor, very likely they’ll let her come home once they’re 
2	PROCTOR	 You’re coming to that court with me, Mary. You will tell it in 
2	MARY	 I cannot charge murder on Abigail….
2	PROCTOR	 You will tell the court how that poppet come here and who stuck the 
2	MARY	 She’ll kill me for sayin’ that! Abby’ll charge lechery 
2	PROCTOR	  …She’s told you!
2	MARY	 I have known it, sir. She’ll ruin you with it, I know she will.
2	PROCTOR	  Good. Then her saintliness is done with. We will 
2	MARY	 I cannot. They’ll turn on me.
2	PROCTOR	  My wife will never die for me. I will bring your guts into your mouth, but that goodness will not die for me.
2	HATHORNE	Now, Martha Corey, there is abundant evidence in our hands to show 
2	MARTHA	 I am innocent to a witch. I know not what a witch is.
2	HATHORNE	 How do you know then that you are not a witch?
2	MARTHA	 If I were I would know it. 
2	HATHORNE	 Why do you hurt these children? 
2	MARTHA	 I do not hurt them. I scorn it!
2	COREY	 I have evidence for the court!
2	DANFORTH	 You will keep your seat!
2	COREY	 Thomas Putnam is reachin’ out for land! 
2	DANFORTH	 Remove that man, Marshal!
2	COREY	 You’re hearing lies, lies!
2	HATHORNE	 Arrest him, Excellency!
2	COREY	 I have evidence, why will you not hear my evidence! They’ll be 
2	HATHORNE	 How do you dare come roarin’ into this court! Are you gone daft, 
2	COREY	 You’re not a Boston judge yet, Hathorne. You’ll not call 
2	DANFORTH	 Who is this man?
2	PARRIS	 Giles Corey, sir, and a more contentious…
2	COREY	 I am asked the question and I am old enough to answer it! My name is 
2	DANFORTH	 And how do you imagine to help her cause with such contemptuous riot? 
2	COREY	 They’re tellin’ lies about my wife, sir, I …
2	DANFORTH	 Then you take it upon yourself to decide what this court shall believe 
2	COREY	 Your Excellency, we mean no disrespect for…
2	DANFORTH	 Disrespect, indeed!-It is disruption, Mister. This is the highest 
2	COREY	 Your Excellency, I only said she were readin’ books, sir, and they 
2	DANFORTH	 What books, what…?
2	COREY	 It is my third wife, sir, and I never had no wife that be so taken with 
2	HALE	 Excellency, he claims hard evidence for his wife’s defense. I think 
2	DANFORTH	 Then let him submit his evidence in proper affidavit. You are certainly 
2	WILLARD	 Come now, Giles.
2	NURSE	 We are desperate, sir; we come here three days now and cannot be heard.
2	DANFORTH	 Who is this man? 
2	NURSE	 Francis Nurse, your Excellency.
2	HALE	 His wife’s Rebecca that were condemned this morning.
2	NURSE	 Excellency, we have proof of it, sir. They are all deceiving you.
2	HATHORNE	 This is contempt, sir, contempt!
2	DANFORTH	 Peace, Judge Hathorne. Do you know who I am, Mister Nurse? 
2	NURSE	 I surely do, sir, and I think you must be a wise judge to be what you 
2	DANFORTH	  And do you know that near to four hundred are in the 
2	NURSE	 I…
2	DANFORTH	 And seventy-two condemned to hang by that signature?
2	NURSE	  Excellency, I never thought to say it 
2	PARRIS	  Mary Warren! What, what are you about here?
2	PROCTOR	 She would speak with the Deputy-Governor.
2	COREY	 She has been strivin’ with her soul all week, Your Honor; she comes 
2	DANFORTH	 Who is this?
2	PROCTOR	  John Proctor, sir. Elizabeth Proctor is my wife.
2	PARRIS	 Beware this man, Your Excellency, this man is mischief.
2	HALE	  I think you must hear the girl, sir, she…
2	DANFORTH	  Peace. What would you tell us, Mary Warren?
2	PROCTOR	  She never saw no spirits, sir.
2	DANFORTH	  Never saw no spirits?!
2	COREY	  Never.
2	PROCTOR	  She has signed a deposition, sir….
2	DANFORTH	 No, no, I accept no deposition. Tell me, Mister Proctor, have you 
2	PROCTOR	 We have not.
2	PARRIS	 They’ve come to overthrow the court, sir! This man is…
2	DANFORTH	 I pray you, Mister Parris. Do you know, Mister Proctor, that the entire 
2	PROCTOR	 I know that, sir.
2	DANFORTH	 And you, Mary Warren… how came you to cry out people for sending 
2	MARY	  It were pretense, sir.
2	DANFORTH	  Ah? And the other girls? Susanna Wallcott, 
2	MARY	 Aye, sir.
2	DANFORTH	 Indeed. Now, Mister Proctor, before I decide whether I shall hear 
2	PROCTOR	 It is. And you will surely know it.
2	DANFORTH	 I take it you came here to declare this revelation in the open court 
2	PROCTOR	 I thought I would, aye… with your permission.
2	DANFORTH	 Now, sir—what is your purpose in so doing?
2	PROCTOR	 Why, I… I would free my wife, sir…
2	DANFORTH	 There lurks nowhere in your heart, nor hidden in your spirit, any 
2	PROCTOR	 Why, no, sir.
2	DANFORTH	  I tell you straight, Mister—I have 
2	PROCTOR	 It is the children only, and this one will swear she lied to you.
2	DANFORTH	 Judge Hathorne! 
2	HATHORNE	 Aye, she’s the one.
2	DANFORTH	 Mister Proctor… this morning, your wife sent me a claim in which 
2	PROCTOR	 My wife pregnant!
2	DANFORTH	 There be no sign of it—we have examined her body.
2	PROCTOR	 But if she says she is pregnant, then she must be! That woman will 
2	DANFORTH	 She will not?
2	PROCTOR	 Never, sir, never.
2	DANFORTH	 Mister Proctor, if I should tell you now that I will let her be kept 
2	PROCTOR	 I… I think I cannot.
2	DANFORTH	 Then your purpose is somewhat larger?
2	PARRIS	  He’s come to overthrow this court, Your Honor!
2	PROCTOR	  These are my friends. Their wives are also…
2	DANFORTH	  I judge you not, sir. Sit down. I am 
2	PROCTOR	  I come not to hurt the court, I only… 
2	DANFORTH	 Marshal, go into the Court and bid Judge Stroughton and Judge Sewall 
2	PROCTOR	  Will you read this first, sir? It’s 
2	DANFORTH	  How many names are here?
2	NURSE	 Ninety-one, Your Excellency.
2	PARRIS	 These people should be summoned for questioning.
2	NURSE	  Mister Danforth, I gave them all my word no harm would come 
2	PARRIS	 This is a clear attack upon the court!
2	HALE	  Is every defense an attack upon 
2	DANFORTH	  Mister Cheever, have warrants drawn for 
2	NURSE	 I have brought trouble on these people, I have….
2	DANFORTH	 No, old man, you have not hurt these people if they are of good conscience. 
2	PROCTOR	 No, she’s not, sir.  Now remember what the angel Raphael said to the boy Tobias. 
2	MARY	  Aye.
2	PROCTOR	 “Do that which is good and no harm shall come to thee.”
2	DANFORTH	 Come, man, we wait you.
2	COREY	 John, my deposition, give him mine.
2	PROCTOR	 Aye.  This is 
2	DANFORTH	 Oh? 
2	HATHORNE	  What lawyer drew this, Corey?
2	COREY	 You know I never hired no lawyer in my life, Hathorne.
2	DANFORTH	  It is very well-phrased. My compliments. 
2	COREY	 I have the best, sir—I am thirty-three time in court in my life. 
2	DANFORTH	  Oh, then you’re much put-upon.
2	COREY	 I am never put-upon; I know my rights, sir, and I will have them.  Aye, there he is!
2	DANFORTH	 Mr. Putnam, I have here an accusation by Mr. Corey against you. He 
2	PUTNAM	 It is a lie!
2	DANFORTH	 What proof do you submit for your charge, sir?
2	COREY	 My proof is there!  If Jacobs hangs for a witch he forfeit 
2	DANFORTH	 But proof, sir, proof….
2	COREY	  The proof is there!—I have it from an honest man 
2	HATHORNE	 And the name of this man?
2	COREY	  I will not give you no name. I mentioned my wife’s name 
2	DANFORTH	  In that case, I have no choice but to arrest 
2	COREY	 This is a hearing; you cannot clap me for contempt of a hearing.
2	DANFORTH	 Oh, it is a proper lawyer! Do you wish me to declare the court in 
2	COREY	 I cannot give you no name, sir, I cannot….
2	DANFORTH	 You are a foolish old man. Mr. Cheever,  begin 
2	PROCTOR	 Your Honor… he has the story in confidence, sir, and he…
2	PARRIS	 The Devil lives on such confidences!  Without confidences 
2	HATHORNE	 I think it must be broken, sir.
2	DANFORTH	  Old man, if 
2	HALE	 Excellency…
2	DANFORTH	 Mister Hale.
2	HALE	  We cannot blink it more. There is a prodigious fear of 
2	DANFORTH	  Reproach me not with the fear in the country; 
2	HALE	 But it does not follow that everyone accused is part of it.
2	DANFORTH	 No uncorrupted man may fear this court, Mister Hale!  None! Mr. Corey, you are under arrest in contempt of this court. Now 
2	PROCTOR	 No, Giles!
2	COREY	 I’ll cut your throat, Putnam! I’ll kill you yet.
2	PROCTOR	  Peace, Giles, peace! We’ll prove ourselves, 
2	COREY	 Say nothin’ more, John. He’s only playing you. He means to 
2	DANFORTH	 This is a court of law, Mister. I’ll have no effrontery here.
2	PROCTOR	 Forgive him, sir, for his old age. Peace, Giles, we’ll prove 
2	DANFORTH	 We know all this.
2	PROCTOR	 Ay, sir. She swears now that she never saw Satan; nor any spirit, vague 
2	DANFORTH	 Her deposition, Mister Proctor. 
2	PARRIS	  I should like to question…
2	DANFORTH	  
2	MARY	 No, sir.
2	DANFORTH	 Has he ever threatened you?
2	MARY	 No, sir.
2	DANFORTH	 Then you tell me that you sat in my court, callously lying when you 
2	MARY	  I did, sir.
2	DANFORTH	 How were you instructed in your life?—Do you not know that God 
2	MARY	 No, sir—I am with God now.
2	DANFORTH	 You are with God now.
2	MARY	 Aye, sir.
2	DANFORTH	 I will tell you this—you are either lying now, or you were lying 
2	MARY	 I cannot lie no more. I am with God, I am with God…. 
2	DANFORTH	 Sit you down, children.  Your friend Mary Warren 
2	ABIGAIL	  No, sir.
2	DANFORTH	 Children, a very auger bit will now be turned into your souls until 
2	ABIGAIL	 I have naught to change, sir. She lies.
2	DANFORTH	  You would still go on with this?
2	MARY	  Aye, sir.
2	DANFORTH	  A poppet were discovered in Mister Proctor’s house, 
2	ABIGAIL	  It is a lie, sir. 
2	DANFORTH	 While you worked for Mister Proctor, did you see poppets in that house?
2	ABIGAIL	 Goody Proctor always kept poppets.
2	PROCTOR	  Your Honor, my wife never kept no poppets. Mary Warren confesses 
2	CHEEVER	 Your Excellency.
2	DANFORTH	 Mister Cheever.
2	CHEEVER	 When I spoke with Goody Proctor in that house, she said she never kept 
2	PROCTOR	 She has not been a girl these fifteen years, your Honor.
2	HATHORNE	 But a poppet will keep fifteen years, will it not?
2	PROCTOR	 It will keep if it is kept, but Mary Warren swears she never saw no 
2	DANFORTH	  You are charging Abigail Williams with a marvelous 
2	PROCTOR	 I do, sir. I believe she means to murder.
2	DANFORTH	  This child would murder your wife?
2	PROCTOR	 It is not a child, sir. Now hear me, sir. In the sight of the congregation 
2	DANFORTH	  What’s this? Laughter during…!
2	PARRIS	 I… do believe it happened once—she is sometimes silly, but 
2	COREY	 Ay, now she is solemn and goes to hang people!
2	DANFORTH	 Quiet, man….
2	HATHORNE	 Surely it have no bearing on the question, sir. He charges contemplation 
2	DANFORTH	 Aye….  But it strikes hard upon me that she 
2	PROCTOR	 Mary.—Now tell the Governor how you danced in the woods.
2	DANFORTH	  What is this dancing?
2	MARY	 I…  
2	PROCTOR	 Abigail lead the girls to the woods, your Honor, and they have danced 
2	PARRIS	 Your Honor, this…
2	PROCTOR	 Mister Parris discovered them there in the dead of night!—there’s 
2	DANFORTH	 Mister Parris…
2	PARRIS	 I can only say, sir, that I never found any of them—naked, and 
2	DANFORTH	 You discovered them dancing in the woods?  Abigail?
2	HALE	 Excellency, when I first arrived from Beverly, Mister Parris told me that.
2	DANFORTH	 Do you deny it, Mister Parris?
2	PARRIS	 I do not, sir, but I never saw any of them naked.
2	DANFORTH	 But she have danced?
2	PARRIS	  Aye, sir.
2	HATHORNE	 Excellency, will you permit me? 
2	DANFORTH	 Pray, proceed.
2	HATHORNE	 You say you never saw no spirits, Mary, were never threatened or afflicted 
2	MARY	  No, sir.
2	HATHORNE	 And yet, when people accused of witchery confronted you in court, 
2	MARY	 That were pretense, sir.
2	HATHORNE	 Then can you pretend to faint now?
2	MARY	 Now?
2	PARRIS	 Why not? Now there are no spirits attacking you, for none in this room 
2	MARY	 Faint?
2	PARRIS	 Aye, faint! Prove to us how you pretended in the court so many times.
2	MARY	  I… cannot faint now, sir.
2	PROCTOR	  Can you not pretend it?
2	MARY	 I… I have no sense of it now, I…
2	DANFORTH	 Might it be that here we have no afflicting spirit loose, but in the 
2	MARY	  I never saw no spirits.
2	PARRIS	 Your Excellency, this is a trick to blind the court.
2	MARY	 It’s not a trick! I… I used to faint because… I… 
2	DANFORTH	 Thought you saw them!
2	MARY	 But I did not, your Honor.
2	HATHORNE	 How could you think you saw them unless you saw them?
2	MARY	 I… I cannot tell you how, but I did. I… I heard the other 
2	PARRIS	 Surely your Excellency is not taken by this simple lie.

2	DANFORTH	  Mister Hale, Mister Hale!WILLARD:  Good morning, Majesty.
2	DANFORTH	 Where is Mister Parris?
2	WILLARD	 I’ll fetch him.
2	DANFORTH	 Marshal. When did Reverend Hale arrive?
2	WILLARD	 It were toward midnight, I think.
2	DANFORTH	  What is he about here?
2	WILLARD	 He goes among them that will hang, sir. And he prays with them. He

2	DANFORTH	 Fetch Mister Parris.
2	WILLARD	 Aye, sir. 
2	HATHORNE	 Let you question Hale, Excellency; I should not be surprised he have 
2	DANFORTH	 We’ll come to that; speak nothin’ of Andover. Parris prays 
2	HATHORNE	 I think sometimes Parris has a mad look these days. 
1	PARRIS	  Oh, good morning, sir, thank you for comin’. 
1	DANFORTH	 Reverend Hale have no right to enter this…
1	PARRIS	 Excellency, a moment.
1	HATHORNE	 Do you leave him alone with the prisoners?
1	DANFORTH	 What’s his business here?
1	PARRIS	  Excellency, hear me. It is a providence. 
1	DANFORTH	 He bids her confess?
1	PARRIS	  Hear me.  Rebecca 
1	DANFORTH	 Why—this is indeed a providence. And they soften, they soften?
1	PARRIS	 Not yet, not yet. But I thought to summon you, sir, that we might think 
1	DANFORTH	 Vanished! 
1	PARRIS	 I had thought to advise you of it earlier in the week, but…
1	DANFORTH	 Why?—how long is she gone?
1	PARRIS	 This be the third night—Mercy Lewis is gone, too.
1	DANFORTH	  I shall send a party for them. Where may they be?
1	PARRIS	 Excellency, I think they be aboard a ship. My daughter tells me now 
1	HATHORNE	  She have robbed you?!
1	PARRIS	 Thirty-one pound is gone. I am penniless.
1	DANFORTH	  Mister Parris, you are a brainless man!
1	PARRIS	 Excellency, it profit nothing you should blame me. I cannot think they 
1	DANFORTH	  There is no rebellion in Andover.
1	PARRIS	 I tell you what is said here, sir. Andover have thrown out the court, 
1	HATHORNE	 Riot!—Why, at every execution I have seen naught but high satisfaction 
1	PARRIS	 Judge Hathorne—it were another sort that hanged till now. Rebecca 
1	DANFORTH	 How do you propose, then?
1	PARRIS	 Excellency… I would postpone these hangin’s for a time.
1	DANFORTH	 There will be no postponement.
1	PARRIS	 Now Mister Hale’s returned, there is hope, I think—for if 
1	DANFORTH	 Cheever, give me the list. 
1	PARRIS	 It cannot be forgot, sir,  that when I summoned the congregation 
1	DANFORTH	 There will be no postponement.
1	PARRIS	 Excellency…
1	DANFORTH	 Now, sir—which of these in your opinion may be brought to God? 
1	PARRIS	  Excellency… a dagger… 
1	DANFORTH	  What do you say?
1	PARRIS	 Tonight, when I open my door to leave my house—a dagger clattered 
2	DANFORTH	 Accept my congratulations, Reverend Hale; we are gladdened to see 
2	HALE	 You must pardon them. They will not budge. The sun will rise in a few 
2	DANFORTH	 Now hear me, and beguile yourselves no more. I will not receive a 
2	HALE	 All but Proctor. He is in the dungeon.
2	DANFORTH	  What’s Proctor’s way now? 
2	WILLARD	  He sits like some great bird; you’d 
2	DANFORTH	  His wife… his wife must be well on with child now.
2	WILLARD	 She is, sir.
2	DANFORTH	 What think you, Mister Parris?—You have closer knowledge of 
2	PARRIS	 It is possible, sir—he have not laid eyes on her these three months. 
2	DANFORTH	  Fetch Goody Proctor to me. Then let you bring him up. 
2	WILLARD	 Ay, sir. 
2	HALE	 Excellency, if you postpone a week, and publish to the town that you are 
2	DANFORTH	 Mister Hale, as God have not empowered me like Joshua to stop this 
2	HALE	  If you think God wills you to raise rebellion, 
2	DANFORTH	 You have heard rebellion spoken in Salem?
2	HALE	 Excellency, there are orphans wandering from house to house; abandoned 
2	DANFORTH	 Mister Hale, have you preached in Andover this month?
2	HALE	 Thank God they have no need of me in Andover.
2	DANFORTH	 You baffle me, sir. Why have you returned here?
2	HALE	 Why, it is all simple. I come to do the Devil’s work. I come to
