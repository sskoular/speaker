1	SUSANNA	 Aye, sir, I pray for her. 
1	ABIGAIL	 Uncle, the rumor of witchcraft is all about; I think youœôòùd best 
1	PARRIS	 And what shall I say to them? That my daughter and my niece I discovered 
1	ABIGAIL	 Uncle, we did dance; let you tell them I confessed it. But theyœôòùre 
1	PARRIS	 Abigail, I cannot go before the congregation when I know you have not 
1	ABIGAIL	 We did dance, Uncle, and when you leaped out of the bush so suddenly, 
1	PARRIS	 Child. Sit you down. Now look you, child-if you trafficked with spirits 
1	ABIGAIL	 I know it, Uncle.
1	PARRIS	 There is a faction that is sworn to drive me from my pulpit. Do you 
1	ABIGAIL	 I think so, sir.
1	PARRIS	 Now then-in the midst of such disruption, my own household is discovered 
1	ABIGAIL	 It were only sport, Uncle!
1	PARRIS	 I saw Tituba waving her arms over the fire when I came on you; why were 
1	ABIGAIL	 She always sings her Barbados songs and we dance. 
1	PARRIS	 I cannot blink what I saw, Abigail-for my enemies will not blink it. 
1	ABIGAIL	 No one was naked! You mistake yourself, Uncle!
1	PARRIS	 I saw it! Now tell me true, Abigail. Now my ministryœôòùs at stake; 
1	ABIGAIL	 There is nothinœôòù more. I swear it, Uncle.
1	PARRIS	 Abigail, is there any other cause than you have told me, for Goody Proctor 
1	ABIGAIL	 They want slaves, not such as I. Let them send to Barbados for that, 
1	PARRIS	 Why, Goody Putnam, come in.
1	ANN	 It is a marvel. It is surely a stroke of hell upon youœôó¦
1	PARRIS	 No, Goody Putnam, it isœôó¦
1	ANN	 How high did she fly, how high?
1	PARRIS	 Noœôòôno, she never flewœôó¦

1	PARRIS	 Now, look you, Goody Putnam; she neverœôó¦ Oh, good morning, Mister Putnamœôó¦
1	PUTNAM	 It is a providence the thing is out now! It is a providence.
1	PARRIS	 Whatœôòùs out, sir, whatœôòùsœôó¦?
1	PUTNAM	  Why, her eyes is closed! Look you, Ann.
1	ANN	 Why, thatœôòùs strange. Ours is open.
1	PARRIS	 Your little Ruth is sick?
1	ANN	 Iœôòùd not call it sick, the Devilœôòùs touch is heavier than sick, 
1	PARRIS	 Oh, pray not! Why, how does your child ail?
1	ANN	 She ails as she mustœôòôshe never waked this morning but her eyes open 
1	PUTNAM	 They say youœôòùve sent for Reverend Hale of Beverly? 
1	PARRIS	 A precaution only. He has much experience in all demonic arts, and I 
1	ANN	 He has indeed, and found by a witch in Beverly last year, and let you remember 
1	PARRIS	 I pray you, leap not to witchcraft. I know that you, you least of all,

1	PARRIS	 But, Thomas, you cannotœôó¦
1	PUTNAM	 Ann! Tell Mister Parris what you have done.
1	ANN	 Reverend Parris, I have laid seven babies unbaptized in the earth. Believe 
1	PARRIS	 To Tituba! What may Titubaœôó¦.?
1	ANN	 Tituba knows how to speak to the dead, Mister Parris.
1	PARRIS	 Goody Ann, it is a formidable sin to conjure up the dead!
1	ANN	 I take it on my soul, but who else may surely tell us who murdered my babies.
1	PARRIS	 Woman!
1	ANN	 They were murdered, Mister Parris! And mark this proof! œôòómark it! 
1	PUTNAM	 Donœôòùt you understand it, sir? There is a murdering witch among 
1	PARRIS	 Then you were conjuring spirits last night.
1	ABIGAIL	 Not I, sir, not I.-Tituba and Ruth.
1	PARRIS	 Now I am undone.
1	PUTNAM	 You are not undone. Let you take hold here. Wait for no one to charge 
1	PARRIS	 In my house!? In my house, Thomas?-they will topple me with this! They

1	ABIGAIL	 Uncle, youœôòùve prayed since midnight. Why do you not go down andœôó¦.?
1	PARRIS	 No-no. Iœôòùll wait till Mister Hale arrives.

1	PARRIS	 I have no stomach for disputation this morning. I will lead them in 
1	ANN	 Mercy, you go home to Ruth, dœôòùye hear?
1	MERCY	 Aye, Mum. 
1	PARRIS	 If she starts for the window, cry for me at once. 
1	ABIGAIL	 Yes, Uncle.  How is Ruth sick?
1	MERCY	 Itœôòùs weirdish, I know notœôòôshe seems to walk like a dead one 
1	ABIGAIL	 Now look you, if they be questioning us tell them we dancedœôòôI 
1	MERCY	 And what more?
1	ABIGAIL	 He saw you naked.
1	MERCY	 Oh, Jesus! 
1	MARY	 I just come from the farm, the whole countryœôòùs talking witchcraft! 
1	ABIGAIL	  Betty? Now, Betty, dear, wake up now. Itœôòùs 
1	BETTY	  You drank blood, Abby, you drank blood!
1	ABIGAIL	  Betty, you never 
1	BETTY	 You did, you did! You drank a charm to kill John Proctorœôòùs wife!

1	REBECCA	 I cannot fathom that!
1	PUTNAM	 When Reverend Hale comes you will proceed to look for signs of witchcraft 
1	PROCTOR	 You cannot command Mister Parris. We vote by name in this society, 
1	PUTNAM	 I never heard you worried so on this society, Mister Proctor. I do not 
1	PROCTOR	 I have trouble enough without I come five mile to hear him preach only 
1	PARRIS	 I am your third preacher in seven years. I do not wish to be put out

1	PROCTOR	 Can you speak one minute without we land in hell again? I am sick of 
1	PARRIS	 It is not for you to say what is good for you to hear!
1	PROTCTOR	 I may speak my heart, I think!
1	PARRIS	 What, are we Quakers? We are not Quakers here yet, Mister Proctor. And 
1	PROCTOR	 My followers!
1	PARRIS	 There is a party in this church; I am not blind; there is a faction 
1	PROCTOR	 Against you?
1	PUTNAM	 Against him and all authority.
1	PROCTOR	 Why, then I must find it and join it.
1	REBECCA	 He does not mean thatœôó¦.
1	PROCTOR	 I mean it solemnly, Rebecca; I like not the smell of this œôòüauthority,œôòý

1	PARRIS	 Why, Rebecca, we may open up the boil of all our troubles today!
1	REBECCA	 Let us hope for that.  I go to God for you, sir.
1	PARRIS	 I hope you do not mean we go to Satan here!
1	REBECCA	 I wish I knew. 
1	PUTNAM	 Come, Mister Hale, letœôòùs get on. Sit you here. 
1	COREY	 Mister Haleœôó¦ I have always wanted to ask a learned manœôòôWhat 
1	HALE	 What books? 
1	COREY	 I cannot tell; she hides them. Martha, my wife. I have waked at night

1	ELIZABETH	 I forbid her go, and she raises up her chin like the daughter of 
1	PROCTOR	 Court! What court?
1	ELIZABETH	 Ay, it is a proper court they have now. Theyœôòùve sent four judges

1	PROCTOR	 You will not go to that court again, Mary Warren.
1	MARY	  I must tell you, sir, I will be gone every day now. I am 
1	PROCTOR	 What work you do! Itœôòùs strange work for a Christian girl to hang

1	ELIZABETH	 Pregnant! Are they mad?œôòôthe womanœôòùs near to sixty!
1	MARY	  They had Doctor Griggs examine her 
1	PROCTOR	 Iœôòùll official you!

1	MARY	  I saved her life today! 
1	ELIZABETH	  I am accused?
1	MARY	 You were somewhat mentioned. But I said I never see no sign you ever sent 
1	ELIZABETH	 Who accused me?
1	MARY	 I am bound by law; I cannot tell it.
1	PROCTOR	  Go to bed.
1	MARY	 Iœôòùll not be ordered to bed no more, Mister Proctor! I am eighteen

1	PROCTOR	  Good night, then! 
1	MARY	 Good night. 
1	ELIZABETH	 Oh, the noose, the noose is up!
1	PROCTOR	 Thereœôòùll be no nooseœôó¦
1	ELIZABETH	 She wants me dead; I knew all week it would come to this!
1	PROCTOR	 They dismissed it. You heard her sayœôó¦

1	PROCTOR	 Sit you downœôó¦
1	ELIZABETH	 She wants me dead, John, you know it!
1	PROCTOR	 I say sit down! Now, we must be wise, Elizabeth.
1	ELIZABETH	 Oh, indeed, indeed!
1	PROCTOR	 Fear nothing. Iœôòùll find Ezekiel Cheever. Iœôòùll tell him 
1	ELIZABETH	 John, with so many in the jail, more than that is needed now, I think. 
1	PROCTOR	 What have I to say to Abigail?
1	ELIZABETH	 Johnœôó¦grant me this. You have a faulty understanding of young 
1	PROCTOR	 What promise?
1	ELIZABETH	 Spoke or silent, a promise is surely made. And she may dote on it 
1	PROCTOR	 She cannot think it.
1	ELIZABETH	 John, have you ever shown her somewhat of contempt? She cannot pass 
1	PROCTOR	 I may blush for my sin.
1	ELIZABETH	 I think she sees another meaning in that blush.
1	PROCTOR	 And what see you? What you see, Elizabeth.
1	ELIZABETH	 I think you be somewhat ashamed, for I am there, and she so close.
1	PROCTOR	 When will you know me, woman? Were I stone I would have cracked for 
1	ELIZABETH	 Then go-and tell her sheœôòùs a whore. Whatever promise she may 
1	PROCTOR	 Good, then. Iœôòùll go.

1	PROCTOR	 I surely did come when I could, and when I could not I prayed in this 
1	HALE	 Mister Proctor, your house is not a church. A Christian on Sabbath Day 
1	PROCTOR	 Aye. Boys.
1	HALE	 How come it that only two are baptized?
1	PROCTOR	  I like it not that Mister Parris should lay his hand upon my

1	PROCTOR	 It may be I have been too quick to bring the man to book, but you cannot 
1	HALE	 Iœôó¦ haveœôó¦ there is a softness in your record, sir, a softness.
1	ELIZABETH	 I think, maybe, we have been too hard with Mister Parris. I think
